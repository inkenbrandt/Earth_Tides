#Earth Tides & Barometric Efficiency
===========

Scripts used to examine time series groundwater level data.

This includes Tidal files created by Paul Gettings.

These scripts were generated to analyze data from the Utah Geological Survey <a href=geology.utah.gov/databases/groundwater/map.php?proj_id=1>Snake Valley Groundwater Monitoring Network</a>.

They still need significant refinement.

So far, I have written a notebook containing some of the more useful scripts.
