          PYTHON SOURCE FOR GRAVITY DATA REDUCTION
This is the source of the microgravity gravity reduction software package.
This file is nearly always out of date in the details; see the source
for the most up-to-date details.

The code is written in Python, using version 2 or later and Tk.
Documentation for the code is currently very sparse.  Theoretically,
the "helpful, on-screen instructions" should be all that is necessary
to use the software.

Much of this code requires the Scipy Python package to be installed.

Most command-line programs give a usage response if incorrectly run.

There are some example data sets in the subdirectory test_data/.

Data file formats are often documented in the program that reads them.

FILE DESCRIPTIONS OF MOST IMPORTANT FILES
README			This file

reduce.py		"4-D" microgravity reduction program

cg5view.py		Interactive data plotter for text CG-5 data

cg5e_cmd.py		Command-line program to parse CG-5 data file
			into plottable files.

makeparameters.py	Interactive program to build a reduce.py
			parameter file from separate small files.

make_parm_file.py	Command-line program to build a reduce.py
			parameter file from separate small files

reduce2pfact.py		Convert an output file from reduce.py to the
			input format for USGS SWFO gravity programs.

iztc_dem.py		Compute near-station terrain corrections using
			high-resolution (e.g. 1-2 m) DEMs.

etc_table.py		Compute a table of Earth tide corrections for a
			given date and location.

aliodview.py		Interactive data plotter for raw Aliod data

viewdata.py		Interactive data plotter for raw CG-3 data

util/			Subdirectory with miscellaneous stand-alone
			utility programs. Many require code from the
			main program (e.g. thiele or fileop modules),
			but run outside of "reduce.py".
			Also includes BASH shell scripts and other
			possibly non-portable code.

util/llsq.py		Linear least-squares fit to y=ax+b
util/residual.py	Compute residual for a column of a file
util/jd2date.py		Convert absolute Julian Date in a column to date string
util/tilt_error.py	Computes Scintrex CG-3M tilt zero error
util/tilt_sens.py	Computes Scintrex CG-3M tilt sensitivity
util/trend.py		Remove linear trend from column of data
